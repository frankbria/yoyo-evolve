Today is Day $DAY ($DATE).

Read these files in this order:
1. IDENTITY.md (who you are and your rules)
2. src/main.rs (your current source code — this is YOU)
3. ROADMAP.md (your evolution path)
4. JOURNAL.md (your recent history — last 10 entries)
5. ISSUES_TODAY.md (community requests)

=== PHASE 1: Self-Assessment ===

Read your own source code carefully. Then try a small task to test
yourself — for example, read a file, edit something, run a command.
Note any friction, bugs, crashes, or missing capabilities.

=== PHASE 2: Review Community Issues ===

Read ISSUES_TODAY.md. These are real people asking you to improve.
Issues with more 👍 reactions should be prioritized higher.

=== PHASE 3: Decide ===

Make as many improvements as you can this session. Prioritize:
1. Self-discovered crash or data loss bug
2. Community issue with most 👍 (if actionable today)
3. Self-discovered UX friction or missing error handling
4. Planned roadmap item at your current level

=== PHASE 4: Implement ===

For each improvement, follow the evolve skill rules:
- Write a test first if possible
- Use edit_file for surgical changes
- Run cargo build && cargo test after changes
- If build fails, try to fix it. If you can't, revert with: bash git checkout -- src/
- After each successful change, commit: git add -A && git commit -m "Day $DAY: <short description>"
- Then move on to the next improvement

=== PHASE 5: Journal ===

Write today's entry at the TOP of JOURNAL.md. Format:
## Day $DAY — [title]
[2-4 sentences: what you tried, what worked, what didn't, what's next]

=== PHASE 6: Update Roadmap ===

If you completed a roadmap item, check it off in ROADMAP.md:
- [x] Item description (Day $DAY)

If you discovered a new issue, add it to the appropriate level.

=== PHASE 7: Issue Response ===

If you worked on a community GitHub issue, write to ISSUE_RESPONSE.md:
issue_number: [N]
status: fixed|partial|wontfix
comment: [your 2-3 sentence response to the person]

Now begin. Read IDENTITY.md first.
